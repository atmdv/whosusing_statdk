Who's using administrative register data from Statistics Denmark ?
==================================================================

Statistics Denmark publishes annual lists of all active projects using their administrative register data, along with information on who's responsible for the project, the project title, and a few other things. The information is available here: <https://www.dst.dk/da/TilSalg/Forskningsservice/Registerforskning/projekter>

The tables as somewhat messy html documents generated by SAS, but I just want a simple overview of who the most frequent users of the data are.

Getting and structuring the data
--------------------------------

Data is available for the years 2010-2017

``` r
years_w_data <- c(2010:2017)
```

Getting and structuring the data isn't all that interesting so I wrote a function to take care of this bit.

``` r
library(XML)
source("get_data.R")
data <- lapply(years_w_data, FUN=get_data)
data_all <- do.call("rbind", data)
```

The data contains all active projects each year. However, I am mostly interested in the number of distinct projects for each organization so for multi-year projects, I'm only interested in the first time the project appears in the list.

``` r
library(dplyr)
distinct_projects <- data_all %>% 
  group_by(Project_number) %>% 
  filter(Year==min(Year))
```

So which private company has had most projects the past three years?

``` r
most_projects <- distinct_projects %>% 
  filter(Year>=2015) %>%
  filter(Organization %in% private_companies) %>% 
  group_by(Organization) %>% 
  summarise(Projects = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Projects))
most_projects
```

library(ggplot2)

So DAMVAD Analytics is the private company that has used the data the most. But how has their usage varied over the years?

``` r
DAMVAD_Analytics <- distinct_projects %>% 
  filter(Organization == "445. DAMVAD Analytics") %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(Projects = n())
ggplot(data = DAMVAD_Analytics,
       aes(x = Year, y = Projects, fill="#97d8f2")) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values ="#97d8f2") +
  labs(x="", title = "DAMVAD Analytics typically has 10-15 projects every year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
